I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/script.rpy", line 91, in script
    "When creating your own item, it's essential to follow these specific steps. First, place your icons into the designated folder that contains all of my dummy icons. Then, create variables using the default Python .append function shown in the screenshot. kile this:  $ inventory.append("Mango") "
  File "renpy/common/00library.rpy", line 330, in say
    who(what, interact=interact, *args, **kwargs)
Exception: Say has image attributes ('Mango',), but there's no image tag associated with the speaking character.
