Welcome to my Simple Ren'Py Inventory System! When I first created this project, I was a beginner exploring the Ren'Py engine, and it’s been part of my ongoing learning journey. Inspired by a simple tutorial, I built this system to be straightforward, flexible, and easy to integrate into your games—while also adding my own improvements and creating a version that fits my needs.

Starting with a basic, empty list, this system provides a solid foundation for new developers, without the added complexity of more advanced inventory systems. It’s perfect for creating beginner-friendly games.

I've also developed an advanced version with features like unlockable slots and item stacking. Check out my other repositories for further extensions and improvements. I hope it serves as a helpful resource for others diving into Ren'Py!
 
Here is the enhanced version of this inventory if you are interested: [Enhanced Renpy Inventory](https://github.com/Patchmonk/Enhanced-Renpy-Inventory)
